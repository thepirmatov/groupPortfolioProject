                <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
                <p>Here is a little about myself.</p>
                <p>Hello! I'm a final-year Software Engineering student at a North American university, passionate about creating and exploring the limitless possibilities in the world of technology. My journey in software development has been guided by a philosophy I hold dear, inspired by Socrates: "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." This mindset fuels my curiosity and drives my desire to continually learn and grow.

                    Throughout my academic career, I've engaged in several exciting projects. One of my favorites was developing the NAU Cafe website, a collaborative effort that taught me the importance of teamwork and innovation in real-world applications. Additionally, I spearheaded the creation of a functioning product landing page dedicated to iconic football cleats, merging my passion for sports with my software development skills.
                    
                    When I'm not coding or buried in books, you can find me engaging in various activities that keep me energized and inspired. I'm an avid UFC fan, a football player, a weightlifter, and a book lover. These hobbies not only challenge me physically and mentally but also provide a well-rounded perspective that I bring into my professional work.
                    
                    I am eager to bring my hardworking spirit and fresh ideas into the tech industry as I approach graduation. If you're interested in learning more about my projects or discussing potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out through the contact section..</p>
